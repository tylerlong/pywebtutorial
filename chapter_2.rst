Chapter 2: A demo app
=====================
In this chapter, weâ€™ll develop a simple demonstration application to show off some of the power of Python. The purpose is to get a high-level overview of Python web programming (and web development in general) by rapidly generating an application using scaffold generators. As discussed in Box 1.1, the rest of the book will take the opposite approach, developing a full application incrementally and explaining each new concept as it arises, but for a quick overview (and some instant gratification) there is no substitute for scaffolding. The resulting demo app will allow us to interact with it through its URIs, giving us insight into the structure of a Python application, including a first example of the REST architecture favored by Python.
