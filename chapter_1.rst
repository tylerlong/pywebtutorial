Chapter 1: from zero to deploy
==============================

Weldome to `Python Web Tutorial: Learn Python Web Development by Example`_. The goal of this book is to be the best answer to the question, “If I want to learn web development with Python, where should I start?” By the time you finish the Python Web Tutorial, you will have all the skills you need to develop and deploy your own custom web applications with Python. You will also be ready to benefit from the many more advanced books, blogs, and screencasts that are part of the thriving Python educational ecosystem.


Note that the goal of this book is not merely to teach Python, but rather to teach web development with Python, which means acquiring (or expanding) the skills needed to develop software for the World Wide Web. In addition to Python, this skillset includes HTML & CSS, databases, version control, testing, and deployment. To accomplish this goal, Python Web Tutorial takes an integrated approach: you will learn Python by example by building a substantial sample application from scratch. You can think of the Python Web Tutorial as a video game where you are the main character, and where you level up as a Python developer in each chapter. (The exercises are the minibosses.)
